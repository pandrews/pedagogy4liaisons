## _Pedagogy for Liaisons: Resources for the subject Librarians and Liaisons at the UNT Libraries_

### Introduction: About the Project and Intended Uses
>This repository is a digtal copy of an annotaed bibliography produced for the UNT Libraries' Liaison Workgroup. This digital platform allows for collaboration between the UNT liaisons to produce a list of resources for self-directed learning in pedagogy and theory in librarianship that may inform librarianship practices at the UNT Libraries.

The annotated bibliography aims to provide librarians with resources to help them start: 1) exploring the connections between literacy, pedagogy, philosophy, and theory in librarianship; 2) exploring library pedagogies as well as pedagogies from other disciplines that compliment library work; and 3) exploring strategic ways to engage with faculty and instructional designers. 

Most annotations in this bibliography were created from abstracts or author-provided summaries of each work. Therefore, they vary in length and depth. 

This annotated bibliography is not exhaustive. Liaisons are encouraged to add to this work. The complier intends for this bibliography and its assocated documents to be a living project in that all UNT liaisons may add to it as the UNT Libraries' Liaison Workgroup progresses through pedagogy and similar topics in training meetings. If there are materials that you would like added to this list or if you would like to revise an existing annotation, please send them to the Liaison Workgroup Co-Chairs or the project complier, Brea Henson. 

Materials in this digital annotated bibliopgrahy are linked to the catalog and database holdings at the UNT Libraries. Those materials currently unavailable in the catalog can be requested for purchased and are marked thusly. New items should be sent to the complier for purchase. 

_Each year a .pdf version is archived in the [UNT Scholarly Works Repository](/https://digital.library.unt.edu/explore/collections/UNTSW/)._
